      The above links are linking in bootstrap css and js, version 3.3.5, and this allowed me to incorporate and use bootstrap 
      in order to make my website responsive by using a hamburger menu in my nav bar that would appear and expand in mobile view
      And also allow the user to navigate the page just as in desktop view. The bootstrap offers a template for many different projects,
      And I wanted a simple page with a navbar that had a hamburger menu.
